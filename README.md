# 2019_coding_goals :rocket:

Every new year is connected with fresh thoughts, ideas and goals. Regarding the latest, lists are important to remind you of what you want to achieve. Being a computer engineering nerd :neckbeard:, I decided to create a programmer's wishlist for the new year. 

May the code be with you:



- [ ] break my personal github daily commits record
- [ ] commit every day for 30 days in a row
- [ ] increase the average daily commits number to 20
- [ ] do random, absolutely not useful, pet projects I have been thinking of
- [ ] document all my projects extensively
- [ ] learn a new technology/framework (game development, react, anything)
- [ ] use more vim


## Under construction :hammer:

Let's extend the list :orange_book: .

## A year in review

For every achieved goal in the list, there will be a relevant link.

Happy coding :100:
